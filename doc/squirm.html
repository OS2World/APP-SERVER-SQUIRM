Squirm is a fast &amp; configurable redirector for the <a
href="http://squid.nlanr.net">Squid Internet Object Cache</a>.
It requires the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/order/ftp.html">GNU Regex
Library</a> (now included in the Squirm source), and of course, a working
<a href="http://squid.nlanr.net">Squid</a>.  It is available free under
the terms of the <a href="GPL">GNU GPL</a>.

<b>Note:</b>  This web page documents version 1.0-BetaB.  There is,
in fact, a newer version: <a href="squirm-1.23.tgz">squirm-1.23</a>, but
I haven't documented it yet.  This new version has some new features:
<menu>
<li>new squirm.conf file allows different redirection lists based
upon different sets of source network addresses in CIDR notation.
<li>Automagic accelerator string generation.
<li>It compiles with a simple 'make'
<li>A few other minor features.
<li>Use your systems regex library
</menu>

<h2>Features</h2>


<p>
Squirm has the following features:

<ul>
<li>Very, very fast
<li>Virtually no memory usage
<li>It can re-read it's config files while running by sending it a HUP signal
<li>Interactive test mode for checking new configs
<li>Full regular expression matching and replacement
<li>Config files for patterns and IP addresses.
<li>If you mess up the config file, Squirm runs in <em>Dodo Mode</em> so
your squid keeps working :-)
</ul>

<p>
I started writing it because the existing redirector scripts used too much
memory and all were too slow for Squids that receive a lot of requests.

<p>
On my Pentium Pro 200 running Linux, it manages to do 16,440 lines
per second (that's 59 million lines per hour!) using my
<A href="squirm.local">squirm.local</a> and <a
href="squirm.patterns">squirm.patterns</a> config files.

<p>
It can handle nifty things like file mirrors with the regex pattern
replacement strings, and do site blocking - useful for schools.  It could
also do such things as banner add rewriting, and just about anything
else :-)

<h2>Installing Squirm</h2>

<p>
<ol>
<li>Untar the <a href="squirm-1.0betaB.tar">Squirm tar file</a>

<p>
<li>Compile the GNU Regex library by doing:

<pre>
cd regex
./configure
make clean
make
cp -p regex.o regex.h ..
</pre>

This step is a bit ugly - I welcome anyone who has experience with the
<tt>configure</tt> script to incorporate this directly into Squirm -
Anyone ?

<p>
<li>Search for <em>cache_effective_user</em> in your Squid configuration
file (usually <tt>/usr/local/squid/etc/squid.conf</tt> and take note of
the Squid user and group id that squid runs under.  (Squirm won't work
if Squid executes as <em>root</em>!)

<p>
<li>Edit the Makefile and find the <tt>install:</tt> section. You will
need to change the installation user and group id to the ones Squid
executes as.  (The default is user <tt>squid</tt>, group <tt>squid</tt>).
If you don't want to install Squirm in <tt>/usr/local</tt>, you'll need
to change the directory paths as well.

<p>
<li>If you changed the directory path for Squirm in the Makefile above,
then you will need to edit the file <tt>paths.h</tt> to reflect the new
path for log files.

<p>
<li>type <tt>make</tt>

<p>
<li><em>su</em> to root and type <tt>make install</tt>

<p>
<li>Try running squirm to make sure the installation worked:

<table>
<tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">
<pre>
orbit:/usr/local/src/squirm-1.0betaB# whoami
root

</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
(Yep, it did work, the error above indicates that the config files
don't yet exist :-)

<p>
<li>Once you have Squirm up and running, to get Squid to pass requests
through Squirm, you need to add a couple of lines to your squid.conf
file:

<pre>
redirect_program /usr/local/squirm/bin/squirm
redirect_children 10
</pre>

the number of children is dependant on the load on your squid box.
Try 10 and use the cachemgr.cgi CGI to see if all redirector processes
get used, and if they do, you can raise this number.

</ol>

<a name="config"></a>
<hr>
<h2>Configuring Squirm</h2>

<p>
By default, the two config files are located as
<tt>/usr/local/squirm/etc/squirm.local</tt> and
<tt>/usr/local/squirm/etc/squirm.patterns</tt>

You need to create these two files from scratch with the aid of the
following instructions:

<a name="squirm_local"></a>
<h3>Local Addresses</h3>

You need to place abbreviations for class C networks in the
<tt><b>squirm.local</b></tt> file for your clients.  Here's an example:

<pre>
127.0.0
10.2.3
192.168.1
</pre>
</td>
</tr>

<p>
These are used to determine if Squirm should rewrite a URL.  You wouldn't
normally want any Squid neighbours to be able to use your redirector
as the extra load of ICP requests would bog down your machine, so don't
include them in the file.

<p>
For the above config file, requests to the Squid from 10.2.3.4 would be
accepted, whilst requests from 1.2.3.4 would be ignored.

<p>
There is currently no plan to implement CIDR notation because Squirm
uses simple integer comparisons to make lookups really quick.

<a name="squirm_patterns"></a>
<h3>Squirm Patterns</h3>

<h4>Syntax</h4>

<p>
The syntax of lines in the <tt><b>squirm.patterns</b></tt> file 
are of the form:
<pre>
	regex|regexi pattern replacement [[^]accelerator_string[$]]
</pre>
or
<pre>
	abort .filename_extension
</pre>



<h4><tt>regex|regexi</tt></h4>
<p>
Full regex matching and replacement is made available by the use of the
GNU Regex libary.  It also supports pattern buffers.

<p>
Let's say you want to redirect requests to a local URL for a common
file, where it's matched case sensitively:
<pre>
regex  ^.*/n32e301\.exe$ http://www.mydomain/path_to/n32e301.exe
</pre>
this means: replace URLs ending in /n32e301.exe with the URL of your
local copy.

<p>
To do the same as above except case insensitively, you would use
<tt>regexi</tt> instead of <tt>regex</tt> at the start of the line.

<h4>Accelerator Strings</h4>

<p>
The accelerator string is used to avoid regex comparisons of URLs
unless they are <em>close</em> to the pattern expected.  Squirm
first compares a URL against the accelerator string before it
bothers do do a proper regex comparson, and saves many CPU cycles
on a busy machine. Note: you should always use accelerator strings
if possible on a busy box!

<p>
For the above example, a speedup is acheived through the use of the
accelerator string <tt>n32e301.exe$</tt>, so the line would look like:

<pre>
regex  ^.*/n32e301\.exe$ http://www.mydomain/path_to/n32e301.exe n32e301.exe$
</pre>

<p>
The accelerator string can have a leading caret '^' OR a trailing dollar
'$' to indicate that the rough match should search at the start of end
of the URL respectively.

<h4>Abort Extensions</h4>

<p>
The reason behind use of the abort extension is a massive speedup
by aborting pattern searches for URLs that end in a certain filename
extension. (Why traverse the entire patterns list and do comparisons
when they won't be matched anyway ?)

<p>
Let's say we don't need to traverse the list for files ending in 
<tt>.gif</tt>.  The line needed is:
<pre>
abort .gif
</pre>

regex .*/cc32e401\.exe$ http://redirector1.senet.com.au/cc32e401.exe cc32e401.exe$
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>
The first line contains an accelerator string <tt>^http://tucows.</tt>
so Squirm has to do the regex comparison only if the URL matches
it. Because this is the first line in the squirm.patterns file, much time
is saved by not having to do a regex comparison for every single URL.
(Accelerator strings are not compulsary on a config line, but the speed
improvement is quite large.)

<p>
The first regex comparison uses a case insensitive pattern which matches
HTTP for any hostname beginning with <em>tucows</em>.  It stores the
path information in a pattern buffer which is later replayed in the URL
replacement by using <tt>\1</tt> (up to 10 replays possible)

<p>
The <tt>abort</tt> extensions are used so that comparisons for none of
the following lines continues unless they don't match filenames listed
in the abort lines.  It is wise to include the most frequent filename
extension of requests in cases where the abort extension can be used,
but not filename extensions that occur infrequently.  <tt>.gif, .jpg,
.html, .htm</tt> are good candidates for the abort extension.

<a name="school_examples"></a>
<h3>Examples for Schools</h3>

<p>
You may wish to have a way of blocking access to sites which contain
material unsuitable for viewing by children and return them a web page
which let's them know they have requested a site which is blocked.

<h4>Simple Block List</h4>

<pre>
regexi ^http://www\.playboy\.com/.* http://www/notallowed.html
regexi ^http://www\.xxx\.com/.* http://www/notallowed.html
</pre>

<p>
This will return the URL <tt>http://www/notallowed.html</tt> to
anyone requesting URLs starting with <tt>http://www.playboy.com</tt>
or <tt>http://www.xxx.com</tt>

<p>
For long lists for sites to block the use of accelerator strings
may help, in which case the above example would be:

<pre>
regexi ^http://www\.playboy\.com/ http://www/notallowed.html ^http://www.playboy.com
regexi ^http://www\.xxx\.com/ http://www/notallowed.html ^http://www.xxx.com
</pre>

<h4>Block List with URL notification</h4>

<p>
If you would like to include the blocked URL requested in the resulting
page (something like "The URL http://www.playboy.com/file.jpg has been
blocked", you could create a CGI which takes the URL as an argument,
and add the request to the pattern replacement.

<pre>
regexi ^(http://www\.playboy\.com/.*) http://www/cgi-bin/na?url=\1
</pre>

This might be a good choice for a list of hostnames you may already
have to add to the list, for example:

<pre>
cat list-of-banned-sites \
	| sed -e "s/\./\\\./g" \
	| awk '{ print "regexi ^(http://" $1 "/.*) http://www/cgi-bin/na?url=\1" }' \
	>> /usr/local/squirm/etc/squirm.patterns	
</pre>

<p>
Again, adding accelerator strings to long lists may help with speed.


<a name="testing"></a>
<hr>
<h2>Testing Squirm Interactively</h2>

<p>
When Squirm is run as root, it goes into interactive mode which echoes
all information that would normally be logged to standard error output.
This gives the opportunity to test a configuration file modification
before restarting the current squirm processes on the machine.

<p>
Optionally, you can supply the path of a squirm patterns config file,
if it's not in the default location, for the first argument.

<p>
Squid sends requests to the standard input of a redirector process with
the form:
<pre>
	URL   src_address   ident   method
</pre>
The <em>ident</em> field is usually a dash '-'. For Squirm to do any
redirection, the method is <em>GET</em> and the <em>src_address</em>
must match an address from the <tt>squirm.local</tt> file.

<p>
The following text is an example of running squirm interactively, with
the input lines to test marked in bold:

<table>
</tr>
<td bgcolor="#ffffff">
<pre>

http://www.somewhere.com/path/file 127.0.0.1 - GET
<b>[Ctrl + D]</b>
</pre>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Alternatively you can provide input from a file by using the syntax:
<pre>
/usr/local/squirm/bin/squirm < filename
</pre>


<a name="logs"></a>
<hr>
<h2>Squirm Log Files</h2>

<p>
There are several log files in <tt>/usr/local/squirm/logs</tt> which
are normally only viewable by the squid user id and root:

<dl>
<dt>squirm.debug
<dd>Contains verbose info if DEBUG is defined when compiling
<dt>squirm.error
<dd>Contains messages for invalid config or other alert conditions
<dt>squirm.fail
<dd>Lists instances where length of URL was too short (< 4 chars)
<dt>squirm.info
<dd>Squirm restarts and reconfigurations
<dt>squirm.match
<dd>Shows URLs which were successfully replaced by a pattern replacement
</dl>

The <tt>/usr/local/squid/logs</tt> directory *must* be writeable by the
user id that Squid executes as.  This was set up for you when <tt>make
install</tt> was executed.


<a name="hup"></a>
<hr>
<h2>Reconfiguring Squirm</h2>

<p>
When you have modified either <tt>squirm.local</tt> or
<tt>squirm.patterns</tt> all of the running squirm processes need to
be restarted by a HUP signal.

<p>
(Restarting Squid will do this (by sending squid a HUP signal), but this
usually isn't convenient because it makes squid become unvailable for
a period of time.)

<p>
Under Linux, you can do this by typing:
<pre>
	killall -HUP squirm
</pre>

<p>
On other systems you may have to write a small script:
<pre>
#!/bin/sh
for PID in `ps -aux | grep redirector | grep -v grep | awk '{ print $2 }'`
do
	kill -HUP $PID
done
</pre>
